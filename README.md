# time-series-cluster-analysis
This is a time series cluster analysis for ridership over seven years. My goal was to compare over 1000 station pairs, check their patterns over time (42 representative days), cluster them according to their patterns, and visualize each cluster. I was able to accomplish this using Python's Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
